This project involves training and evaluating (LSTM) models and BERT on a financial news dataset. The models are trained for a number of epochs, and the loss and accuracy for each epoch are displayed. After training, the models are evaluated on a test set, and the accuracy and F1 score are calculated.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following main parts:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 
2. **Data Preprocessing**
3. **Feature Extraction**
4. **Model Training**
5. **Model Evaluation**

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to have Python installed on your machine. You will also need the following Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, gensim, Keras, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn.

## Usage

To run the project, execute the main script. The script will load the data, preprocess it, extract features, train the models, and evaluate them.

## Results

The results of the model training and evaluation are displayed in the console. For each model, the loss and accuracy for each training epoch are displayed, as well as the final accuracy and F1 score on the test set.
